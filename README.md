# Robot Learning from Human Demonstrations with Unexpected Obstacles During Task Reproduction. 

## Motivation
Standard motion primitive frameworks assume that the environment in which a robot is trained will be identical to the environment in which it is used.
This assumption doesnâ€™t hold true in most real-world situations

## Goal
To develop a system that learns to perform tasks through demonstration and autonomously avoid obstacles during task reproduction

## Method
* Learn tasks through demonstration using Kernelized Movement Primitives
* Use a motion planner to generate a path with minimum possible points
* Extrapolate KMP to pass through the points generated by motion planner during task reproduction

## Directory Details
* **2D_toy_problem** has the complete system implemented for a 2D obstacle avoidance problem built using pygame
* **src** has the files that implement KMPs for a Kuka IIWA arm simulated using Pybullet
* **pickled_objects** contains trained kmps as pickle files
* **training_data** contains the data used to train KMPs

## Dependencies
* Pyrobolearn
